= Service Level Indicators

This page explains and defines Service Level Indicators (SLI) that are being measured continuously by the platform.

== SLI: Uptime

Uptime conditions::
- Redis responds to 95% of "ping" requests within a 1-minute interval.
  The requests are originating from within the same cluster.

Downtime conditions::
- Redis is not responding to "ping" requests within a 1-minute interval.

[NOTE]
====
- Instances in downtime caused by customer error or abuse do not count towards downtime in SLAs.
- Some health conditions may cause a complete downtime, but may not be treated as "down".
====

== SLI: Health

Degraded conditions::
- Redis responds between 1% and 95% of "ping" requests within a 1-minute interval.
- The configured storage volume is full.
- Redis continues to serve read operations, but denies write operations.
- Instance is being automatically updated to a minor or patch version.
- Instance is being manually upgraded to a major version.
- Instance is being reconfigured by the customer (for example storage expansion).
- The platform itself is in maintenance mode and causes maintenance-related downtimes (for example Node drains).

[NOTE]
====
- Some degraded conditions also lead to complete downtime (for example maintenance).
- Degraded instances do not count towards downtime in SLAs.

== SLI: Backup
